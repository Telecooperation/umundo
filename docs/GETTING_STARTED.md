# Getting started with uMundo

There are three ways to get uMundo up and running on your system:

* A local repository to build uMundo from source
[[more](https://github.com/tklab-tud/umundo/blob/master/docs/BUILDING.md)]
* An installer package with the prebuilt uMundo SDK
[[more](https://github.com/tklab-tud/umundo/blob/master/installer/README.md)]
* A maven snippet in your pom.xml
[[more](https://github.com/tklab-tud/umundo/blob/master/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md#maven-repository)]

To get started, download an [installer](http://umundo.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/installer/)
for your platform and run two instances of <tt>umundo-pingpong</tt> from the
console or from within your installation directory. If you see some *io* on both
ends, your system is setup correctly to run umundo programs. If not see the
[troubleshooting](TroubleShooting) section below.

You can export <tt>UMUNDO&#95;LOGLEVEL=[0..4]</tt> to increase the global log-level,
with 3 being the most verbose. You can also increase/descrease log-levels per
component by exporting <tt>UMUNDO&#95;LOGLEVEL&#95;[COMMON|NET|DISC|S11N]=[0..4]</tt>.
With some terminals, colored output is available via <tt>UMUNDO&#95;LOGCOLORS=[ON|OFF]</tt>.
Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/tklab-tud/umundo/blob/master/core/src/umundo/common/Debug.cpp">Debug.cpp</a>
file to see how the various options are used.

I encourage everyone to [build umundo from sources](https://github.com/tklab-tud/umundo/blob/master/docs/BUILDING.md)
to get the latest features and (more importantly) bug fixes.

## Dependencies

Below are the runtime dependencies for uMundo as the prerequisites to install on a platform in order to develop with and run
uMundo applications.

### Runtime Dependencies

<table>
    <tr><th>Platform</th><th>Dependency</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="1">Mac&nbsp;OSX&nbsp;10.7</td>
		<td>None</td><td>Everything is pre-installed.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="1">iOS 5.x</td>
		<td>None</td><td>Everything is pre-installed.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="1">Windows&nbsp;7</td>
		<td>None</td>
		<td>We include an embedded mDNS implementation. It is, however, preferred to install bonjour as a service available through an
			iTunes installation or the somewhat obscure "<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?viewlocale=en_US">Bonjour Print Services
			for Windows</a>". You will have to recompile uMundo with <tt>DISC_BONJOUR_EMBED=OFF</tt> to use the system-wide service.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="1">Linux</td>
		<td><a href="http://avahi.org/">Avahi</a></td>
		<td>Again, we need a mDNS implementation for discovery and Avahi is preinstalled on most Linux distributions. If Avahi is not an option,
			you can rebuild uMundo with the embedded Bonjour mDNS server.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td rowspan="1">Android</td>
		<td>None</td><td>We build the Android native library with an embedded Bonjour mDNS server, so everything is included.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

### Basic Concept

You start by instantiating a node and add it to a discovery object. Then you add
publishers and subscribers specifying their channel name in the constructor. The subscriber
also requires a receiver when invoking its constructor. There are some basic facts that you
can rely upon, or that we would at least consider bugs if observed otherwise:

1. Nodes need to be connected via explicit <tt>added(EndPoint)</tt> or a discovery object.
2. A publisher will send messages to a subscriber if they have the same channel name <b>and</b> were added to at least
one pair of nodes within the same domain.
	1. Publishers will not send messages to subscribers within the same node.
2. A publisher or subscriber can belong to several nodes in different domains.
3. You can use the same receiver for many subscribers but only one receiver per subscriber.

### Using Java Bindings

For umundo.core there is a [sample Eclipse project](https://github.com/tklab-tud/umundo/tree/master/examples/java). The API
is the same as in C++, but there are some caveats:

1. You have to subclass <tt>org.core.umundo.Receiver</tt> and override receive(Message msg) to receive messages from a Subscriber.
2. SWIG can not generate Interaces and Java does not support multiple inheritance so the API is a little cumbersome at times.
3. You have to explicitly hold references to every Receiver and eventual Greeters as they are garbage collected otherwise.

#### Java Archive

The JAR file in the installers and in the maven repository uses a static initializer method to automatically load its
platform-specific JNI library from the JAR itself. If this fails, you can still load the JNI library per <tt>System.load()</tt>.
The JAR built for android only contains the native JNI code for the android platform and can not be used on desktop installations.
There are three reasons for seperating the android and the desktop jar: 1) The library name is the same for android and linux, 2)
the android jar can be smaller and 3) renaming the android jar with CMake is a hassle.

The automatic loading of the JNI libraries contained in the Jar is only performed when uMundo is built with <tt>DIST_PREPARE</tt>
to allow custom builds to load the debug JNI library.

#### Maven Repository

We maintain a maven repository for the desktop umundocore JAR file with everything included for MacOSX, Linux 32/64-Bit and Windows 32/64-Bit.
In your <tt>pom.xml</tt> add a new repository and include the umundocore dependency:

    <repositories>
      ...
      <repository>
        <id>tu.darmstadt.umundo</id>
        <name>uMundo at TK</name>
        <url>http://umundo.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/maven2/</url>
      </repository>
    </repositories>

    <dependencies>
      ...
      <dependency>
        <groupId>org.umundo</groupId>
        <artifactId>umundocore</artifactId>
        <version>0.3.1</version>
      </dependency>
    </dependencies>

<b>Note:</b> Have a look at the [maven repository](http://umundo.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/maven2/org/umundo/umundocore/) 
to see the available versions.

## Trouble Shooting

<table>
  <tr><th>Symptom</th><th>Platform</th><th>Comment</th></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>umundo-pingpong only prints "o"</td>
		<td>**Every**</td>
		<td>This is most likely caused by your firewall settings. uMundo uses tcp/4242
			upwards and might use udp/4242 upwards in the future. For iptables with
			Linux you can check with:
			<pre>
	# show all rules for the INPUT chain
	$ sudo iptables -L INPUT
	Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
	REJECT   all -- anywhere anywhere
	# count the rules and remove e.g. first rule from INPUT chain
	$ sudo iptables -D INPUT 1
			</pre>
			The prebuilt binaries from the SDK installers are built against the Avahi
			daemon for Linux, make sure it is running and available (you will have to
			recompile with <tt>DISC_BONJOUR_EMBED</tt> if this is a problem).
			I will not ask whether you actually started <b>two</b> instances.

		<td>**GNU/Linux**</td>
		<td>After installing the libraries the first time, you might need to run <tt>sudo ldconfig</tt> to make them known.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>The program can't start because MSVP100.dll is missing from your computer.
		Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.</td>
		<td>**Windows**</td>
		<td>Contrary to the suggested fix, reinstalling uMundo is not helpful.
